From this tutorial, I have been introduced what is needed for backend and how the frontend and backend link together. 

# What did I learn from this project?
1. MongoDb
2. How to use java for backend
3. How to use react and how to connect the backend to the front end
4. Springboot and postman

# What do I intended to do after this tutorial
In the tutorial, it left the login/registraion as placeholders in the website. With better backend knowledge, I am planning to create the registration process and add more features to the website for logged in users.
